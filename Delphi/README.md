## Installation

Import the registry settings `atom_one_dark_delphi.reg` file corresponding to your Delphi version. If your Delphi version isnâ€™t present, use `regedit` to find out your version number under the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Embarcadero\BDS` key and modify the `.reg` file accordingly. All Delphi versions since at least Delphi 10 Seattle should have similarly organized registry settings. Older Delphi versions (such as old XE and BDS) might be more involving.
